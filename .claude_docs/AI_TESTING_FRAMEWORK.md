# AI Testing Framework for FrostRealm Chronicles

## Overview
This document provides AI-assisted testing strategies for RTS game development, focusing on automated test generation, validation of TFT mechanics, and performance testing using Unity Test Framework and ECS testing patterns.

## Testing Philosophy

### Test Pyramid for RTS Games
```
    E2E (Campaign/Multiplayer)
        Integration Tests
            Unit Tests
```

- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Individual systems, formulas, components
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: System interactions, game loops
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Full gameplay scenarios, campaigns

### AI-Generated Test Categories
1. **Mechanical Accuracy**: TFT formula validation
2. **Performance**: ECS system benchmarks  
3. **Integration**: Cross-system behavior
4. **Regression**: Prevent breaking changes
5. **Balance**: Game state validation

## AI Test Generation Prompts

### Formula Validation Tests
```
Generate Unity Test Framework tests for TFT damage calculation accuracy:

Formula: Reduction = (armor * 0.06) / (1 + armor * 0.06)
Effective Damage = base * type_multiplier * (1 - reduction)

Test Cases:
- Edge cases: 0 armor, very high armor (100+)
- Damage types vs armor types (all combinations)
- Hero vs unit damage scaling
- Known values from TFT guides

Expected: ±0.1 tolerance for floating point
Output: Complete NUnit test class with data-driven test cases
```

### ECS System Tests
```
Generate performance tests for Unity ECS system in FrostRealm Chronicles:

System: [SystemName]
Target Performance: Process 500+ entities in <2ms

Test Requirements:
- Burst compilation validation
- Memory allocation tracking
- Parallel job efficiency
- Stress testing with max entities

Output: Performance test class with profiler markers
```

### Integration Test Generation
```
Create integration test for [SystemA] + [SystemB] interaction:

Scenario: [e.g., "Unit attacks building, resources update, UI refreshes"]
Expected Flow:
1. [Step by step behavior]
2. [Expected state changes]
3. [Event firing sequence]

Generate test with proper setup/teardown and validation
```

## Test Data Management

### ScriptableObject Test Data
```csharp
// Pattern for AI-generated test data
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Test Data", menuName = "FrostRealm/Tests/Unit Data")]
public class TestUnitData : ScriptableObject
{
    [Header("TFT Reference Values")]
    public UnitTestCase[] testCases;
}

[System.Serializable]
public class UnitTestCase
{
    public string unitName;
    public float expectedHP;
    public DamageInfo expectedDamage;
    public string tftSource; // Reference link
}
```

### AI Data Generation Prompt
```
Generate test data for FrostRealm Chronicles unit validation:

Units: [List from GDD]
Required Fields: HP, Damage, Armor, Cost per TFT specs
Format: JSON array for ScriptableObject import

Include edge cases and known problematic values
Validate against official TFT data where available
```

## Automated Test Suites

### Mechanical Accuracy Suite
```csharp
// AI-generated test template
[TestFixture]
public class TFTMechanicsTests
{
    [Test]
    [TestCase(0, 1.0f)] // No armor = no reduction
    [TestCase(5, 0.23f, 0.01f)] // 5 armor ≈ 23% reduction
    [TestCase(100, 0.857f, 0.01f)] // High armor test
    public void DamageReduction_CalculatesCorrectly(int armor, float expectedReduction, float tolerance = 0.001f)
    {
        // AI: Generate implementation
    }
}
```

### Performance Benchmark Suite
```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class PerformanceTests
{
    [Test]
    [Performance]
    public void CombatSystem_Handles500Units_Under2ms()
    {
        // AI: Generate ECS performance test
    }
}
```

### Balance Validation Suite
```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class BalanceTests
{
    [Test]
    public void EconomySystem_UpkeepPenalties_MatchTFT()
    {
        // AI: Test upkeep formula accuracy
    }
}
```

## AI Testing Workflows

### 1. Test-Driven Development
```
Phase 1: Generate Tests First
Prompt: "Generate failing tests for [FEATURE] based on GDD requirements"

Phase 2: Implement Feature
Prompt: "Implement [FEATURE] to pass these tests: [TEST_CODE]"

Phase 3: Refactor
Prompt: "Optimize implementation while maintaining test compatibility"
```

### 2. Regression Prevention
```
Pre-Commit Testing:
1. "Generate regression tests for changes in [FILES]"
2. "Identify potential breaking changes in [MODIFIED_CODE]"
3. "Create validation tests for [AFFECTED_SYSTEMS]"
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```
Continuous Performance Testing:
1. "Generate benchmark tests for [NEW_SYSTEM]"
2. "Create performance regression detection for [CRITICAL_PATH]"
3. "Monitor frame time impact of [CHANGES]"
```

## Mock Systems for Testing

### AI Mock Generation
```
Generate Unity test mocks for FrostRealm Chronicles:

System to Mock: [e.g., ResourceSystem]
Mock Requirements:
- Controllable state for testing
- Event simulation capability
- Performance monitoring hooks

```

### Test Environment Setup
```csharp
// AI-generated test environment

    }
    
    public static void SetupMockSystems(TestWorld world)
    {
        // AI: Register mock systems for testing
    }
