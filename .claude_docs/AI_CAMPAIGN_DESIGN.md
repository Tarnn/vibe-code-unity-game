### AI Testing Framework for Campaigns

#### Automated Campaign Testing
```csharp
// AI-generated campaign testing system
public class CampaignTestSuite : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Test Configuration")]
    [SerializeField] private CampaignMissionData[] missionsToTest;
    [SerializeField] private float testTimeoutMinutes = 30f;
    [SerializeField] private bool testAllDifficulties = true;
    
    public void RunCampaignTests()
    {
        foreach (var mission in missionsToTest)
        {
            TestMissionCompletability(mission);
            TestObjectiveClarity(mission);
            TestDifficultyScaling(mission);
            TestStoryFlow(mission);
        }
    }
    
    void TestMissionCompletability(CampaignMissionData mission)
    {
        // AI bot attempts to complete mission using basic strategies
        // Validates that objectives are achievable
        // Reports impossible or unclear objectives
    }
    
    void TestStoryFlow(CampaignMissionData mission)
    {
        // Validates dialogue trigger timing
        // Checks for story consistency
        // Verifies cutscene asset availability
    }
}
```

## Quality Assurance

### AI Playtesting Simulation
```
Generate AI playtester behaviors for campaign testing:

Playtester Profiles:
- Novice: Basic strategy, follows objectives literally
- Intermediate: Efficient build orders, explores options
- Expert: Advanced tactics, seeks optimal solutions
- Completionist: Explores everything, finds all secrets

Testing Scenarios:
- Direct objective completion (fastest path)
- Exploration-heavy playthrough (find all content)
- Failure recovery (test checkpoint/restart systems)
- Speed run attempt (stress test mission timing)

Metrics to Track:
- Mission completion rates by difficulty
- Average completion time vs target
- Objective clarity (how often players get stuck)
- Story comprehension (dialogue skip rates)
- Difficulty spikes (unusual retry frequency)

Report Generation:
"Analyze playtesting data and generate campaign balance recommendations focusing on pacing, difficulty, and story clarity"
```
