## Audio Implementation

### Unity Audio System Setup

#### Audio Mixer Configuration
```csharp
// AI-generated audio mixer setup
public class AudioMixerSetup : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private AudioMixerGroup masterGroup;
    [SerializeField] private AudioMixerGroup musicGroup;
    [SerializeField] private AudioMixerGroup sfxGroup;
    [SerializeField] private AudioMixerGroup voiceGroup;
    [SerializeField] private AudioMixerGroup ambientGroup;
    
    void Start()
    {
        SetupMixerGroups();
        LoadAudioSettings();
    }
    
    void SetupMixerGroups()
    {
        // Configure ducking for voice lines
        // Setup 3D spatial audio parameters
        // Apply compression for battle clarity
    }
}
```

#### Spatial Audio Implementation
```csharp
// RTS-specific 3D audio manager
public class RTSAudioManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private AudioListener playerListener;
    [SerializeField] private float maxAudioDistance = 50f;
    
    public void PlayUnitSound(Vector3 position, AudioClip clip, float volume = 1f)
    {
        // Calculate distance attenuation for RTS camera
        var distance = Vector3.Distance(position, playerListener.transform.position);
        var attenuatedVolume = CalculateVolumeAttenuation(distance, volume);
        
        // Play audio with spatial positioning
        AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(clip, position, attenuatedVolume);
    }
    
    float CalculateVolumeAttenuation(float distance, float baseVolume)
    {
        if (distance > maxAudioDistance) return 0f;
        return baseVolume * (1f - distance / maxAudioDistance);
    }
}
```

### Dynamic Music System
```csharp
// Adaptive music system for RTS gameplay
public class DynamicMusicManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Music Tracks")]
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip menuMusic;
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip[] factionThemes;
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip[] battleMusic;
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip victoryMusic;
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip defeatMusic;
    
    [Header("Combat Music Triggers")]
    [SerializeField] private int combatThreshold = 3; // Units in combat
    [SerializeField] private float musicTransitionTime = 2f;
    
    private GameState currentState;
    private int unitsInCombat;
    
    void Update()
    {
        TrackGameState();
        UpdateMusicBasedOnState();
    }
    
    void TrackGameState()
    {
        unitsInCombat = CountUnitsInCombat();
        
        if (unitsInCombat >= combatThreshold)
        {
            TransitionToState(GameState.Battle);
        }
        else
        {
            TransitionToState(GameState.Peace);
        }
    }
}
```

## Audio Quality Assurance

### AI Audio Post-Processing
```
Audio Enhancement Workflow:

1. Generation: Use AI tools for base audio creation
2. Cleanup: Remove artifacts, normalize levels
3. Processing: Apply EQ, compression for game context
4. Testing: Validate in Unity with 3D positioning
5. Optimization: Compress for memory efficiency

Post-Processing Prompts:
"Enhance this audio for RTS gameplay: increase clarity, reduce frequency conflicts with voice lines, optimize for spatial audio positioning"
```

### Audio Testing Framework
```csharp
// Automated audio testing for RTS requirements
[TestFixture]
public class AudioSystemTests
{
    [Test]
    public void AudioClips_MeetQualityStandards()
    {
        foreach (var clip in GetAllAudioClips())
        {
            Assert.IsTrue(clip.frequency >= 44100, "Audio frequency too low");
            Assert.IsTrue(clip.length <= 10f, "Audio clip too long for gameplay");
            Assert.IsNotNull(clip.name, "Audio clip missing name");
        }
    }
    
    [Test]
    public void SpatialAudio_WorksAtGameplayDistances()
    {
        var testPosition = new Vector3(25, 0, 25);
        var audioManager = FindObjectOfType<RTSAudioManager>();
        
        // Test audio audibility at typical RTS distances
        Assert.IsTrue(audioManager.IsAudibleAtDistance(testPosition, 50f));
    }
}
```

## Audio Budget Management

### Memory Optimization
- **Compression**: OGG Vorbis for all audio
- **Quality Settings**: Adaptive based on importance
- **Streaming**: Large music files streamed, SFX loaded
- **Pooling**: Reuse AudioSource components
- **LOD**: Reduce quality for distant/unimportant sounds

### Performance Targets
- **Total Audio Memory**: <500MB
- **Concurrent Audio Sources**: <64 simultaneous
- **CPU Audio Processing**: <5% frame time
- **Loading Time**: <2 seconds for level audio
- **Latency**: <100ms for responsive feedback

## Advanced Techniques

### Procedural Audio Mixing
```
AI-Assisted Dynamic Mixing:
"Generate audio mixer settings that automatically adjust based on gameplay context:
- Reduce music during important voice lines
- Increase SFX clarity during battles
- Boost ambient audio during peaceful moments
- Maintain overall loudness consistency"
```

### Adaptive Soundscapes
```csharp
// AI-driven environmental audio adaptation
public class AdaptiveSoundscape : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip[] weatherAudio;
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip[] timeOfDayAudio;
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip[] battleIntensityAudio;
    
    void Update()
    {
        var weatherIntensity = GetWeatherIntensity();
        var timeOfDay = GetTimeOfDay();
        var battleIntensity = GetBattleIntensity();
        
        // AI-suggested mixing algorithm
        MixAudioLayers(weatherIntensity, timeOfDay, battleIntensity);
    }
    
    void MixAudioLayers(float weather, float time, float battle)
    {
        // Dynamic mixing based on game state
        // Crossfade between different audio layers
        // Adjust volumes based on gameplay importance
    }
}
```
