# FrostRealm Chronicles ‚Äï Open-Source RTS in Unity 6.1 LTS

FrostRealm Chronicles is a fully open-source real-time-strategy game inspired by *Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne* and modernized with Unity 6.1 LTS, HDRP ray-traced visuals, and ECS/DOTS performance.  
All development, art, audio, balance, multiplayer, and testing workflows are driven by AI and documented in this repository.

## Quick Start for Developers

> **Note for Windows + WSL users** ‚Äì The *.sh scripts are fully supported under WSL.  The helper scripts now auto-detect the WSL environment and will invoke the Windows-installed Unity Editor located in `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.23f1\Editor\Unity.exe`.  Simply run the same commands shown below from your Ubuntu prompt.

### Setup & Build
```bash
# Initial setup (installs dependencies, configures Git LFS)
dev-setup.bat

# Quick build and run
dev-run.bat

# Build only
dev-build.bat

# Run tests
dev-test.bat

# Clean build files
dev-clean.bat
```
