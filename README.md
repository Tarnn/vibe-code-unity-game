# FrostRealm Chronicles ‚Äï Open-Source RTS in Unity 6.1 LTS

FrostRealm Chronicles is a fully open-source real-time-strategy game inspired by *Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne* and modernized with Unity 6.1 LTS, HDRP ray-traced visuals, and ECS/DOTS performance.  
All development, art, audio, balance, multiplayer, and testing workflows are driven by AI and documented in this repository.

## Quick Start for Developers

> **Note for Windows + WSL users** ‚Äì The *.sh scripts are fully supported under WSL.  The helper scripts now auto-detect the WSL environment and will invoke the Windows-installed Unity Editor located in `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.1.12f1\Editor\Unity.exe`.  Simply run the same commands shown below from your Ubuntu prompt.

### Setup & Build
```bash
# Initial setup (installs dependencies, configures Git LFS)
dev-setup.bat

# Quick build and run
dev-run.bat

# Build only
dev-build.bat

# Run tests
dev-test.bat

# Clean build files
dev-clean.bat
```

### Requirements
- **Unity 6000.1.12f1** (Unity 6.1 LTS or newer 6.x build)
  - *Make sure to add the "Linux Build Support (IL2CPP)" module in Unity Hub so the WSL build scripts work.*
- **Unity Hub** (latest version)
- **Git with Git LFS** (for asset management)
- **Windows 10/11** (primary development platform)

---

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Unity 6.1 project setup with HDRP
- Hero data architecture (ScriptableObjects)

## 1. Vision & Scope
* **Gameplay** ‚Äì 4 asymmetrical factions, hero-centric combat, TFT-accurate formulas (+1 damage per primary stat, armor = `(armor*0.06)/(1+armor*0.06)`, etc.).
* **Visual Target** ‚Äì Warcraft III Reforged-quality models (5‚Äì10 k tris heroes, 4 K textures), HDRP with real-time ray tracing.
* **Platforms** ‚Äì PC (Windows/Linux), scalable to Steam Deck.
* **Open & Free** ‚Äì Unity free tier, AI-generated assets using only free tools; everything in this repo is MIT-licensed.

Full design details: `.claude_docs/GAME_PRD.md`, `.claude_docs/GDD.md`, `.claude_docs/TECH_SPECS.md`.

## 3. Development Guides
1. **Build automation** ‚Äì See `dev-*.sh` (Linux/WSL) and `dev-*.bat` (Windows) scripts for one-click build, run, test, and clean.
2. **Continuous Integration** ‚Äì Sample GitHub Actions workflow coming soon to automate builds and tests on every pull request.
3. **Coding standards** ‚Äì C# code follows Microsoft + Unity conventions; run `dotnet format` before committing.

## 4. Asset & Audio Pipelines
* Art uses Blender & Substance Painter; exports land in `Assets/Art/`.
* Audio is generated or recorded at 48 kHz WAV in `Assets/Audio/`.
* Addressables handle asset streaming; see `AddressableAssetsData/`.

## 5. Multiplayer & Networking
Planned Netcode for Entities (Unity's DOTS networking) with Steam Relay fallback.

## 6. Balance, Campaign, & Testing
Balance spreadsheets and campaign scripts live in `.claude_docs/` and are executed via in-Editor tools.

## 7. Project Management & Contribution
* Issues ‚Üí GitHub Issues, labelled `bug`, `feature`, `tech-debt`.
* Branching model ‚Üí **main** (stable) / **dev** (integration) / feature branches.
* Pull requests require passing CI and at least one code-review approval.

## 8. Getting Started (Build / Play)
```bash
# Windows + WSL (Ubuntu)
./dev-setup.sh   # one-time setup, pulls LFS assets
./dev-run.sh     # build & run Linux player via WSL-g or X-server

# pure Windows
dev-setup.bat
dev-run.bat
```
